# Releasing Zerm to the Stream Deck Store

This document outlines the steps for releasing the Zerm plugin to the Stream Deck Store.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your plugin is fully tested on macOS (and Windows if you add support)
2. Ensure all icons are properly converted and displaying correctly
3. Verify that the plugin is stable and working as expected

## Pre-release Checklist
